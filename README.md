## Starter React App
- Initial scaffolding with Create React App, plus some of my own tweaks.

## Running Locally
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:
* `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
* `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This app is not currently deployed to a production environment.
